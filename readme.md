# Snapâ€‹*!*

A collection of libraries to use with [Snap*!*](https://snap.berkeley.edu)

> All screenshots are taken using a custom build of Snap which has slightly different colors, uses Unicode characters instead of canvas drawings and has different fonts.

### Get

[colors.xml](colors.xml)

## Operators

![Showcase of operators](operators.png)

### nth root

The operator ()âˆš() takes two arguments. The first one is the index of the root, the second one is the radicand.

### Variadic +/Ã—

The operator reduces a list by summing or multiplicating all of the items provided.

### Variadic &/|

The operator reduces a list by AND-ing or OR-ing all of the items provided.

### Multiline (â†•)

The operator is a utility for writing multiline strings.

### Code (&lt;/>)

The operator is a utility for writing monospace multiline strings.

### Is (n) an integer

Returns whether `n` is an integer (true) or a floating-point number (false).

### Hex double (hex)

Returns the two hex characters provided as a number. If only one character is provided, returns `(char) * 0x10 + (char)`

### Get

[operators.xml](operators.xml)

## Throw

![Showcase of throw](throw.png)

### Throw (message) (type)

Throws an error `message`. Type is one of `Error`, `RangeError`, `TypeError` and `SyntaxError`.

### Throw (message) (custom type)

Throws an error `message` of type `custom type`. It is up to the user to be sure `custom type` is instantiatable by

```js
new (eval(customType))(message)
```

### Get

[throw.xml](throw.xml)

## Switch

![Showcase of switch](switch.png)

### Switch (what) (...cases) (default)

Switches on `what` for all the `cases`. When one is matched, exits. If none is matched, runs `default`. Cases should all contain `case` blocks.

### Case (case) (run)

To be used inside of `switch`. `run` gets called if `case` matches what `switch` is switching.

> Important: `case` and `switch` work with codification. You can have codification disabled, and it will still work. However, when codificating to another language, either don't codificate `switch` and `case` or cleanup by setting all types' code to `<#1>` and `case`'s code to `<#1>`.

### Get

[switch.xml](switch.xml)

## Window

![Showcase of window](window.png)

### Alert (what)

`window.alert`s `what`.

![Example alert](alert.png)

### Prompt (what)

`window.prompt`s `what` and returns the input.

![Example prompt](prompt.png)

### Confirm (what)

`window.confirm`s `what` and returns `true` if OK (or equivalent) was pressed or `false` if Cancel (or equivalent) was pressed.

![Example confirm](confirm.png)

### Get

[window.xml](window.xml)
